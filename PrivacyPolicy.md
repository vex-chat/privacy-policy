# Privacy Policy

**In short**: We collect as little information as possible from you, and we do *not* share or sell your information with any other company or entity.

## Why You Should Care

Online communication has never been more prevalent in our society. Platforms like Slack, Discord, and Microsoft Teams have become great productivity tools, especially with the current trend of an ever-more-remote society. However, these services do not respect your privacy or your data.

Other message platforms save your conversation history, files uploaded to the service, and some may even intrusively spy on other processes that are running on your computer. Usually, this information is stored alongside other identifying details, such as phone numbers, emails, address information, or similar. 

This is a great deal of personal information that is maintained on you by your messaging service provider. While this in itself is worrying, what is even more worrying is when they either (1) release it to the public or (2) give it to law enforcement. They may release it to the public by accident (hacking, [data breaches](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/slhacked-new-stats-slack-breach/), or simply incompetence), or [intentionally](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html).

Why would they give your message history to law enforcement? They are usually legally compelled to do so. However, they are not required to *collect* this information in the first place. They do it because they want to store and collect the information in order to benefit from it. We don't collect this information, and as as a result, have very little useful information to provide to these type of legal requests.

## What Is Collected

The information that may be collected when you use this service includes:

- Login credentials (the username and password you signed up with)
- Operating system type (e.g. win32 or darwin)
- Encrypted messages and files you send within the service

The messages and files are encrypted by you and decrypted by the intended recipient.
**We do not have access to your decryption keys**, and therefore **can not read or decrypt any of your messages or files**. These keys are generated on your device and never leave your device.

Messages sent are **deleted** from the server after they are fetched by the intended recipient.

## What Isn't Collected

Anything that isn't explicitly stated above is not collected or stored. Some information, like your User agent and IP address, may be automatically sent to our servers when you make a connection to our platform over the internet. This happens with *all* website and internet services you visit.

Because this information could be used to identify you, we do not log (store) it at all. This is unusual, but we believe it's very important in protecting your privacy.

## What Is Shared

We don't share any collected information with any other outside entity, company, or individual. 

Like any other company, we will comply with court ordered legal requests for information when we are legally required to do so. However, we have very little useful information to provide in terms of these legal requests as we try to collect as *little information as possible* in the first place.

## Updates

If we update this security policy, we will provide notice to you by way of an in-app notification and keep a log on this page (https://vex.chat/privacy-policy) of the change history. The privacy policy will be kept in a [public git repository](https://github.com/vex-chat/privacy-policy), so every change will be viewable in a diff-like format.

## Hat Tips

Our privacy policy was influenced by [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)'s privacy policy.
